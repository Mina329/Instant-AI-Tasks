## Compare between statistical algorithms and Non-statistical algorithms in AI

| Characteristic          | Statistical Algorithms               | Non-Statistical Algorithms               |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Foundation**         | Based on statistical principles      | Not primarily based on statistical principles |
| **Data Dependency**    | Heavily dependent on data            | Can operate based on predefined rules or structures |
| **Interpretability**   | Generally more interpretable         | Often less interpretable, especially for complex models |
| **Flexibility**        | May struggle with complex, non-linear relationships | More flexible, can handle non-linear and complex patterns |
| **Robustness**         | Sensitive to outliers and assumptions | Often more robust to outliers and assumption violations |
| **Training/Adaptability** | Require less data for training    | Often require large data and resources for training |
| **Use Cases**          | Traditional statistics, econometrics | Computer vision, NLP, game playing, complex patterns |
