## What is Semi-Supervised learning ?

Semi-supervised learning is a broad category of machine learning that uses labeled data to ground predictions, and unlabeled data to learn the shape of the larger data distribution. Practitioners can achieve strong results with fractions of the labeled data, and as a result, can save valuable time and money.

## What is Neuro Evolution ?

Neuroevolution is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning that involves the use of evolutionary algorithms to evolve neural networks. The term "neuroevolution" is a combination of "neuro," referring to neural networks, and "evolution," representing the process inspired by biological evolution.

In neuroevolution, the idea is to use evolutionary principles, such as selection, crossover (recombination), and mutation, to evolve populations of neural networks.

Neuroevolution is often used for optimization tasks, where the goal is to find a neural network architecture and set of weights that perform well on a specific problem. It has been applied to various domains, including robotics, game playing, and control systems. One notable application of neuroevolution is in evolving neural networks for playing video games, where the algorithm learns strategies and behaviors through evolutionary processes.

## What is Regression Cluster ?

In Regression Clustering (RC), K (>1) regression functions are applied to the dataset simultaneously which guide the clustering of the dataset into K subsets each with a simpler distribution matching its guiding function. Each function is regressed on its own subset of data with a much smaller residue error.

## Types of models (Statistical models vs Non-statistical models)

| Statistical                     | Non-Statistical               |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Linear Regression               | Decision Trees                |
| Logistic Regression             | Support Vector Machines (SVM) |
| Generalized Linear Models (GLM) | Neural Networks               |

## What is Multi-Label Classification ?

Multi-label classification is a machine learning task where an instance (data point) can be assigned to multiple labels simultaneously. In other words, instead of assigning a single label to each instance, the model is trained to predict a set of labels that are relevant to that instance. This is in contrast to traditional single-label classification, where each instance is associated with only one label.
