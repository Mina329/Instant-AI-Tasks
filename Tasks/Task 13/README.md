## Sampling Techniques

1. Probability sampling

- Simple random sampling

```
You want to select a simple random sample of 1000 employees of a social media marketing company. You assign a number to every employee in the company database from 1 to 1000, and use a random number generator to select 100 numbers.
```

- Systematic sampling

```
All employees of the company are listed in alphabetical order. From the first 10 numbers, you randomly select a starting point: number 6. From number 6 onwards, every 10th person on the list is selected (6, 16, 26, 36, and so on), and you end up with a sample of 100 people.
```

- Stratified sampling

```
The company has 800 female employees and 200 male employees. You want to ensure that the sample reflects the gender balance of the company, so you sort the population into two strata based on gender. Then you use random sampling on each group, selecting 80 women and 20 men, which gives you a representative sample of 100 people.
```

- Cluster sampling

```
The company has offices in 10 cities across the country (all with roughly the same number of employees in similar roles). You don’t have the capacity to travel to every office to collect your data, so you use random sampling to select 3 offices – these are your clusters.
```

2. Non-probability sampling

- Convenience sampling

```
You are researching opinions about student support services in your university, so after each of your classes, you ask your fellow students to complete a survey on the topic. This is a convenient way to gather data, but as you only surveyed students taking the same classes as you at the same level, the sample is not representative of all the students at your university.
```

- Purposive sampling

```
You want to know more about the opinions and experiences of disabled students at your university, so you purposefully select a number of students with different support needs in order to gather a varied range of data on their experiences with student services.
```

- Snowball sampling

```
You are researching experiences of homelessness in your city. Since there is no list of all homeless people in the city, probability sampling isn’t possible. You meet one person who agrees to participate in the research, and she puts you in contact with other homeless people that she knows in the area.
```

- Quota sampling

```
You want to gauge consumer interest in a new produce delivery service in Boston, focused on dietary preferences. You divide the population into meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans, drawing a sample of 1000 people. Since the company wants to cater to all consumers, you set a quota of 200 people for each dietary group. In this way, all dietary preferences are equally represented in your research, and you can easily compare these groups.You continue recruiting until you reach the quota of 200 participants for each subgroup.
```

## Data Types

- **Qualitative data**: described by a characteristic
  - **Categorical** (i.e. described as a category)
    - **Nominal data**: an unordered list of categories
- **Quantitative data**: described by a numerical scale
  - **Numerical** (i.e. described as a number)
    - **Ordinal** (in a scale, or ordered by magnitide)
    - **Discrete** (where the data plugs into a limited range of values)
    - **Continuous** (where there is an infinite range of possible values)
      - **Interval** (no true zero value)
      - **Ratio** (there is a true zero value)

## Types of data distributions

- Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution)
- Skewed Distribution
- Uniform Distribution
- Exponential Distribution
- Bimodal Distribution
- Multimodal Distribution
- Poisson Distribution
- Log-Normal Distribution
- Pareto Distribution
- Triangular Distribution
- Weibull Distribution
- Beta Distribution
- Gamma Distribution
- Cauchy Distribution
- Logistic Distribution
- Chi-Square Distribution
- F-Distribution
- Hypergeometric Distribution
- Exponentially Modified Gaussian (EMG) Distribution
- Logit-Normal Distribution

## What is P-value ?

The P value is defined as the probability under the assumption of no effect or no difference (null hypothesis), of obtaining a result equal to or more extreme than what was actually observed. The P stands for probability and measures how likely it is that any observed difference between groups is due to chance.
