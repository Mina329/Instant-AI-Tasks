## What is Incremental learning ? [[ Ref ]](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/what-is-incremental-learning)

Incremental learning is a methodology of machine learning where an AI model learns and enhances its knowledge progressively, without forgetting previously acquired information. In essence, it imitates human learning patterns by acquiring new information over time, while maintaining and building upon previous knowledge. Incremental learning is crucial in scenarios where data arrives in sequential order or where the storage of all data for processing is not feasible.
